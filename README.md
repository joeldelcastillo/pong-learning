# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Atari Pong: A survey

#### CMPT-310

#### Fall 2022

### Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Final Project

Comparing Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods such as DQL, A2C, and SARSA, for Pong can help determine which methods are better at solving this specific credit assignment problem

This project has a focus on using methods that aim to produce human-like behavior in the Atari Game: Pong by changing one of the simple characteristics that RL algorithms take for granted: teach a model based on aleatory position. We will discuss the challenges in learning motor skills and approach this problem from: Teaching the model based on acceleration variation, rather than position variations. Besides, we will define an heuristic function that will punish a high number of action variations in time, and finally, we will outline some promising directions for future practice in this area
